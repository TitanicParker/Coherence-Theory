  <section>
    <h2>What Coherence Theory asks</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        Coherence Theory starts from a simple question:
      </p>
      <p><em>
        When we say we “get” something, what has to be happening, structurally?
      </em></p>
      <p>
        The working assumption is that coherence is not a vague feeling,
        but the result of a small number of repeatable moves that can be
        described geometrically.
      </p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>The core picture (very high level)</h2>
    <p>
      In this project, coherence is modelled as a finite set of
      <strong>operators</strong> and <strong>invariants</strong>.
    </p>

    <h3>Operators</h3>
    <p>
      Operators are basic structural moves that understanding can make.
      In its current form, Coherence Theory assumes six of them, playing
      roles of roughly this kind:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>opening a distinction,</li>
      <li>expanding or elaborating that structure,</li>
      <li>relating parts,</li>
      <li>correcting or realigning,</li>
      <li>integrating into a whole,</li>
      <li>settling or closing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Invariants and the 6×3×3 structure</h3>
    <p>
      When these operators act, they do not produce an unlimited variety
      of outcomes. They stabilise in a finite set of
      <strong>invariants</strong>—repeatable landing patterns of
      coherence that feel “in place”.
    </p>

    <p>
      The current working architecture is:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>6 operators,</li>
      <li>each with 3 submodes,</li>
      <li>each submode with 3 invariants.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This gives <strong>6 × 3 × 3 = 54 invariants</strong>.
    </p>

    <div class="pill-row">
      <span class="pill">6 operators</span>
      <span class="pill">3 submodes each</span>
      <span class="pill">3 invariants per submode</span>
      <span class="pill">54 invariant forms of coherence</span>
    </div>

    <p>
      The detailed list of invariants, their names, and worked examples
      is being developed separately and will be published from this
      repository as it stabilises.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Why sentences?</h2>
    <p>
      Sentences are treated here as the simplest observable traces of
      coherence. Whenever a sentence “makes sense”, something structural
      has already taken place:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>a distinction has been opened,</li>
      <li>possibilities have been expanded and constrained,</li>
      <li>relations have been set up,</li>
      <li>misfits have been corrected,</li>
      <li>and the whole has come to rest in a stable pattern.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Coherence Theory reads each complete sentence as a finite walk
      through its operator–invariant structure. The long-term aim is to
      make this walk explicit enough that it can be studied, compared,
      and tested across many kinds of language.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>What this repository is (now)</h2>
    <p>
      At this stage, the repository is deliberately minimal. It provides:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>a custom license for this early material (<code>LICENSE</code>),</li>
      <li>a short project overview (<code>README.md</code>),</li>
      <li>this conceptual landing page (<code>index.html</code>),</li>
      <li>and, in time, draft documents on operators, invariants,
          and sentence studies as they become stable enough to publish.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The emphasis is on clarity and correctness rather than completeness.
      Everything here should be read as a public draft, not a finished
      theory.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Direction of work</h2>
    <p>
      Ongoing work under the name <strong>Coherence Theory</strong>
      includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>sharpening the geometric description of the six operators,</li>
      <li>articulating and naming the 54 invariants,</li>
      <li>developing a method for walking individual sentences
          through the structure,</li>
      <li>and collecting example sentence studies that can be checked
          and repeated by others.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      As these pieces are clarified, they will be introduced gradually
      into this repository.
