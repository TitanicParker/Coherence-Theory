# Coherence Theory

Coherence Theory proposes that understanding follows a small and repeatable
internal structure, and that ordinary sentences are the simplest place where
this structure becomes visible. The project aims to describe that structure
geometrically and to articulate how coherence moves, stabilises, and completes
itself.

This repository contains the early, formal articulation of that work.

## What this project is

Coherence Theory is an attempt to describe coherence itself:  
how meaning begins, how it develops, how it refines, and how it comes to rest.

It is:

- a **geometric account** of the motions of understanding,  
- a study of **operators** (primitive structural actions),  
- an articulation of **invariants** (stable landing forms of meaning),  
- and a method for reading sentences as **trajectories** across this structure.

The project is deliberately conservative.  
The goal is clarity, correctness, and internal coherence rather than scope.

Everything here should be treated as early but stable conceptual groundwork.

## Core structure

For readers who want a deeper view of the framework, the central documents
are located in `docs/`:

- **`docs/core-theory.md`** — the main conceptual statement of Coherence Theory:
  operators, invariants, the 6×3×3 architecture, and why sentences reveal the
  underlying geometry.

- **`docs/operators.md`** — definitions of the six operators and how they operate
  structurally, cognitively, and expressively.

- **`docs/invariants.md`** — an architectural overview of the 54 invariants:
  six operator families, three submodes each, three invariants per submode
  (6×3×3).

- **`docs/geometry.md`** — a description of the hexagonal coherence manifold:
  why six directions, why 60°, and how stable invariant landings emerge.

- **`docs/walking-sentences.md`** — a practical method for tracing a sentence
  through the operator arc to observe coherence unfolding in real time.

These documents form the spine of the project and will be expanded as the work
continues to stabilise.

## How to begin

If you are new to the project:

1. Start with **`docs/core-theory.md`**  
   It provides the conceptual foundation and explains why coherence is geometric.

2. Read **`docs/operators.md`**  
   to understand the six structural motions that underlie all coherent
   understanding.

3. Read **`docs/invariants.md`**  
   for the architecture of landing points (not the full list).

4. Explore **`docs/walking-sentences.md`**  
   to see how ordinary sentences reveal the structure.

5. Consult **`docs/geometry.md`**  
   for the mathematical intuition behind the coherence manifold.

This small set is enough to grasp the full conceptual structure.

## Status

Coherence Theory is an ongoing project by **Liam Moloney**
(GitHub: **TitanicParker**).  
The material presented here is intentionally concise and foundational.  
It is not intended as a complete exposition but as the first stable public
statement of the framework.

Subsequent work will refine terminology, develop the invariants, expand
pedagogical examples, and introduce formal diagrams of the manifold.

## Purpose

The long-term aim of Coherence Theory is to offer a clear, rigorous description
of how meaning becomes possible.  
By grounding coherence in a geometric structure, the project seeks to unify:

- linguistic intuition,  
- cognitive dynamics,  
- semantic structure,  
- and the phenomenology of understanding.

This repository is the beginning of that formal articulation.
