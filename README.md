## Core structure 

For readers who want a little more detail, the core working structure
is sketched in `docs/`:

- `docs/theory.md` — minimal statement of what Coherence Theory claims.
- `docs/operators.md` — brief note on the six operators.
- `docs/invariants-6x3x3.md` — how the 54 invariants are arranged
  as 6 operators × 3 submodes × 3 invariants.

These documents are intentionally sparse and will be expanded as the
theory is clarified.
