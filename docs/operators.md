# Operators 

In Coherence Theory, **operators** are the basic structural moves that
coherence can make. When something "lands" or "makes sense", it does so
through a short sequence of these moves.

At this early stage, we assume six primary operators. Their exact
names, notation, and phenomenology are still being refined, but they
play roles of this general kind:

1. **Opening a distinction**  
2. **Expanding or elaborating structure**  
3. **Relating parts**  
4. **Correcting or re-aligning**  
5. **Integrating into a whole**  
6. **Settling / closure**

Later versions of this document will give precise names, symbols, and
examples for each operator. For now, this file simply records that:

- Coherence Theory treats operators as real structural units;
- there are six of them in the current working model.
