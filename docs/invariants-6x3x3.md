# Invariants and the 6×3×3 structure

An **invariant** in Coherence Theory is a stable landing pattern of
coherence: a shape that understanding can take which feels "finished"
or "in place".

The current working architecture is:

- 6 operators,
- each with 3 submodes,
- each submode with 3 invariants.

This gives **54 invariants** in total.

It is often useful to think of these as:

- **families** (grouped by operator),
- with **submodes** capturing different ways an operator can act,
- and **invariants** as the specific, nameable landing forms.

This file exists at this stage simply to record the structure and the
count. The detailed list of invariants, names, and examples will be
added once that material has stabilised enough to publish.
