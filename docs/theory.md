# Coherence Theory — minimal statement

Coherence Theory starts from the idea that "getting it" is not vague or
mysterious, but follows a small internal structure. When something
makes sense, a specific pattern of structural moves has already taken
place in awareness.

We treat these structural moves as **operators**. They combine in
constrained ways and stabilise in a finite set of **invariants**:
repeatable landing patterns of coherence.

In its current form, Coherence Theory assumes:

- a small fixed set of operators,
- grouped into families,
- with three submodes per operator,
- and three invariants per submode,

for a total of **6 × 3 × 3 = 54 invariants**.

Ordinary sentences are used as the simplest observable traces of this
structure. This document is only a minimal statement; details are
developed in the other files as they stabilise.
